# hurdcog

**hurdcog** is an attempt to address issues faced by the GNU Hurd project and produce some potentially viable instances through various adaptations & modifications.

## About

The GNU Hurd is a collection of servers that run on top of a microkernel to implement a Unix-like operating system. While ambitious in its design, the Hurd project has faced various challenges over the years. hurdcog aims to tackle these challenges through:

- **Adaptations**: Modernizing components to work with current systems
- **Modifications**: Making practical improvements to enhance stability and usability
- **Experimentation**: Exploring new approaches to make the Hurd more viable

## Goals

- Address long-standing issues in the GNU Hurd ecosystem
- Create working, usable instances of Hurd-based systems
- Contribute improvements back to the community
- Document findings and solutions for others working on similar challenges
